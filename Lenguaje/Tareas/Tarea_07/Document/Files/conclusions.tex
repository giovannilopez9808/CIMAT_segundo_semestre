\section{Conclusions}

The RoBERTuito model have a better result for the sentiment analysis. The RNN, CNN, Bert, RoBERTa models have a lower results than nlp\_cimat, but only BERT and RoBERTa make a prediction better than FerdotSV. The HeatEval dataset was taken to create apply data augmentation, but i think there is an character that raises an error in the GPU from Google Colab. RoBERTuito have a better result than the others models because the pretrained base was excecute wtih a spanish tweet database.
