  abstract  = {It is shown that for systems possessing Young's "Property A" [7] the work in applying the conjugate gradients algorithm [3] may be approximately halved and a vector of storage may be saved by using a technique analogous to that of Golub and Varga [2] for Chebyshev semi-iteration. We illustrate by numerical results on two test problems, and comment on the advantages of the algorithm over successive overrelaxation and Chebyshev semi-iteration.},
